        My name is William and I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about CS
        because of its versatilityâ€”by thinking outside of the box and utilizing what I've learned, I can turn my ideas into reality.
        <br></br><br></br>
        While organizing competitive programming contests on DMOJ, I've deepened my knowledge in algorithms and 
        data-structures and sharpened my critical thinking. Moreover, by participating in a multitude
        of hackathons I've become proficient in various back-end technologies. More recently, I've been 
        building on my foundations by engineering and deploying full-stack applications.
        <br></br><br></br>
        Currently, I'm interested in exploring AI
        and seeking opportunities to apply my problem-solving and technical skills to real-world challenges.
